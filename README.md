## Sorting in Java

Sorting algorithms are a set of instructions that take an array or list as an input and arrange the items into a particular order.
Sorts are most commonly in numerical or a form of alphabetical (or lexicographical) order, and can be in ascending (A-Z, 0-9) or descending (Z-A, 9-0) order.

Since they can often reduce the complexity of a problem, sorting algorithms are very important in computer science.
These algorithms have direct applications in searching algorithms, database algorithms, divide and conquer methods, data structure algorithms, and many more.

## Sorting Algorithms
Some of the most common sorting algorithms are:

-Selection sort
-Bubble sort
-Insertion sort
-Merge sort
-Quick sort
-Heap sort
-Counting sort
-Radix sort
-Bucket sort
